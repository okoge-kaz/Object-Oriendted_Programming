Let us also congratulate and thank the parents and families who have dedicated so much time and effort to your lives.
Each and every one of these family members is also now a valued member of the Tokyo Tech community. A warm welcome to you all.

Our new students may be experiencing a wide range of emotions today. You may be wondering what kinds of academic challenges await you.
Perhaps you are still unsure about what you want to study. Some of you may already know your goal, but you don't quite know where to begin.
Rest assured. Tokyo Tech's dedicated faculty, staff, students are all here to support you. Our student-centered curriculum is designed to
help you develop a personal vision while gaining knowledge and practical experience through our cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research.
Soon after enrollment, you will join the Tokyo Tech Visionary Project, which will bring you together with fellow students, upperclassmen and
-women, and experts in the liberal arts. Discussions with other Team Tokyo Tech members will broaden your perspectives and encourage you to
formulate your own path for the future. The liberal arts will supplement your technical knowledge throughout your journey at Tokyo Tech, and
beyond.
